This repository focuses on data-driven energy forecasting and optimization using SARIMAX and Prophet models.
The models incorporate external regressors to predict future energy consumption trends, with a special focus on cloud data centers.

1 - SARIMAX-based Energy Optimization
Uses Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) to predict primary energy consumption.
Incorporates external factors such as GDP, population, and energy production metrics.

2 - Prophet-based Energy Forecasting in Cloud Centers
Utilizes Facebook's Prophet for time-series forecasting.
Applies external regressors to enhance prediction accuracy.
Focuses on energy consumption forecasting in cloud data centers.
